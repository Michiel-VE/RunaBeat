## Getting Started
This project is a proof of concept application developed to support a thesis. It provides a basic implementation for creating user accounts, saving users' running tracks, and connecting with friends. The primary aim of the project is to explore the feasibility of building a social running app with these features.

## Technical
The main code is written in Angular, and can be converted to an IOS or Android native app with capacitor. The navigation is made more visual with font awesome and styled with TailwindCSS.
User login and saving data is done through Googles Firebase. This is a quick and free way to get started, without bringing extra backend-hosting costs.

## Features
- User account creation: Users can register and create their accounts with a google login.
- Playing music depending on mood, after questionaire.
- Running track recording: The app allows users to record and save their running tracks.
- Friend connections: Users can connect with their friends and view their running activities.

## Installation
As it is only a proof of concept the app is not out to download freely. However you are able to clone the repository and work on it this way.
